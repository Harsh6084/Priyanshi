          I am publishing this, knowing that I've caused you pain. Our long distance journey together has been nothing short of beautiful for the past 8 months. Every interaction, every shared moment meant the world to me.

But, somewhere along the way, I stumbled. I said or did something that hurt you, and for that, I am truly sorry. In the digital realm where words are exchanged, misunderstandings can happen all too easily. I want you to know that I value our connection more than anything. Your presence on this platform has brought light into my life, and the mere thought of losing you fills me with regret. I ask for your forgiveness, Priyanshi. I promise to learn from my mistakes and to be better. Let's rebuild what we have together, stronger than before. Let's continue to share our thoughts, our laughter, and our dreams kyuki i miss all those moments (Holding hands in Khamariya Lake specially).

Your forgiveness would mean everything to me but still I am eagerly awaiting the opportunity to mend our bond and to once again bask in the joy of our long distance reln.
